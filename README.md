Development notes: 

- The project is using an MVC architectue with coodinators.
- I decided not to a networking library for this project, so you can more deeply evalute my programming skills and my fit into the project and the team. Because of that I am using my own lightweight networking layer. It is an older solution I wrote a few years ago. Of course using Combine and reactive programming this networking layer could be improved and simplief, but unfortunatelly I did not had time for this recently, and I think it is out of the scope of this test.
- The project is set up to be scaleable.
